## What does it do?
The AbstractTransitionController is a base class that you extend to provide all the necessary transition functionality to TransitionController that is aimed on your desired framework.
So for example if you have a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) project you will create an AbstractVueTransitionController that extends the AbstractTransitionController. In your projects component folder you then create a TransitionController for your component for example a DummyTransitionController that extends the AbstractVueTransitionController.

## How does it do it?
The AbstractTransitionController relies upon Timeline from [GSAP](https://greensock.com/). It creates timelines for your transitionIn, transitionOut an loopingAnimations. This gives you all the control that GreenSock has to offer, which is great because it‚Äôs a lot!
